### Jekyll starter directory for github project pages.

Features:

- Very simple (the CSS/Layout are easy to edit)
- Based on [Slate](https://github.com/jsncostello/slate) and adapted for
  using twitter bootstrap for base CSS.
- Well organized and as dynamic as possible(the tar/zip download links only
  appear if you set the variables in index.md)
- Responsive
- Beautiful :)

A demo of the theme can be seen [here](http://tarruda.github.com/bootstrap-datetimepicker/).
